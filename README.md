# Catan

### Setup
LMK if there are confusing install options
##### Git
- https://git-scm.com/
##### Unity
- https://store.unity.com/download-nuo
- You need to make an account for a free license
- The installer has a lot of options; someone stream it so I can get you the correct options
##### Optional
- If you want a text editor with visual git, I like VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
