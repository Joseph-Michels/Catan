# Installs
LMK if there are confusing install options or for git questions
#### Git
- https://git-scm.com/
#### Unity
- Make sure to choose "Unity Hub" (https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download)
- You need to make an account for a free license
- After getting Unity Hub, click installs and get "Unity 2020.1.2f1"
  - EVERYONE STAYS ON THE SAME UNITY VERSION OR STUFF BREAKS
- The installer has a lot of options; someone stream it so I can get you the correct options
#### Optional
- If you want a text editor with visual git, I like VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
# Setup
- In Unity: I prefer Window > Layouts > Tall
